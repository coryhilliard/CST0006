# CST0006 - Computer Programming Foundations

This is an "Introduction to Programming" course that I wrote for Algonquin College in Winter 2018.  The previous course curriculum was based on C++ and had a high failure rate.  As everyone knows C++ is a monster of a language and, in my opinion, is a bit too much for a beginner that doesn't even understand the basics of programming yet.

My first goal was to create a course that didn't necessarily focus on any one programming language but instead focused more on programming concepts and for the students to think more like a programmer so that they understand how programming works.  I chose Python 3 as it is one of the easier languages to read, but I used some C syntax to contrast the Python programming examples.

My second goal was to give the students the beginner course that I wish I had the opportunity to take at the beginning of my programming studies.

I am giving this curriculum away for free as I want to allow people to leapfrog over my work, and possibly make this a better course for everyone.  I am giving this away without any expectations, however, if you do use this material, I would like to know about it.  So please send me a note saying where you used it, but it is not required.

## Lessons
I have built this curriculum to be taught over 15 weeks, which includes a reading week, a review week and an exam week.  I've tried to make each week build on the skills learned in the previous week.

## Assignments
Each week there is an assignment that focuses on the lecture material.  I gave each student permission to resubmit their assignments an unlimited amount of times, or until they got perfect as marks are not as important to me as the learning that takes place.  This also keeps the issue of plagiarism down and learning each concept up.  It should be noted that those who resubmitted their assignments until they got perfect, did extremely well on the final exam.  So this approach obviously worked.

## Final Exam
I didn't include an exam in this repository, as I feel that anyone teaching this course should be able to create a fair exam that will allow them to assess their students.
